    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Pickled garlic is a staple side dish in Korea. With a two-step process in this recipe, the garlic loses much of its pungent bite and becomes slightly sweet and tangy.</p>
    <p>Pickled garlic (<em>maneul jangajji</em> – 마늘장아찌) is a staple side dish in Korea. It’s one of my father’s favorite dishes. Jeju Island, where my parents are from, is well known for its abundance of quality garlic. We used to get the freshest garlic shipped from our relatives inJeju –sometimes green young garlic and other times mature garlic.</p>
