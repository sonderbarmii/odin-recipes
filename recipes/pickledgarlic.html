    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Pickled garlic is a staple side dish in Korea. With a two-step process in this recipe, the garlic loses much of its pungent bite and becomes slightly sweet and tangy.</p>
    <p>Pickled garlic (<em>maneul jangajji</em> – 마늘장아찌) is a staple side dish in Korea. It’s one of my father’s favorite dishes. Jeju Island, where my parents are from, is well known for its abundance of quality garlic. We used to get the freshest garlic shipped from our relatives inJeju –sometimes green young garlic and other times mature garlic.</p>
    <strong><ul>Ingredients</ul></strong>
    <li>1 pound fresh garlic about 8-9 whole heads</li>
    <p></p>
    <strong><ul>For the vinegar brine:</ul></strong>
    <li>1 cup vinegar (white or rice vinegar)</li>
    <li>1 tbl non-iodized salt (Kosher salt or sea salt)</li>
    <li>1 cup water (bottled water, preferabl, for less mineral)</li>
    <p></p>>
    <strong><ul>For the soy brine:</ul></strong>
    <li>2/3 cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>3 tbl sugar (use more for sweeter pickles)</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li'>1/3 cup vinegar</li>
    <li>1 quart jar with a lid</li>
    <p></p>
    <ol>Instructions</ol>
    <li>Separate the garlic cloves from the bulbs. Soak in hot water for 30 minutes or longer. Soaking the garlic helps the skins come off easily. Peel and remove the root ends with a small knife. Rinse and drain. Add to the jar.</li>
    <li>Stir the vinegar brine ingredients together until the salt is dissolved. Pour over the garlic cloves. The liquid should fully cover the garlic cloves. Let stand at room temperature for 7 to 10 days or longer without exposure to sunlight.</li>
    <li>Bring the soy sauce, sugar and water a boil, and gently boil for a minute over medium heat. Pour in the vinegar. Drain the vinegar brine from the jar. Pour the soy brine, while still hot, over the garlic cloves.</li>
    <li>Make sure all the garlic cloves are fully covered. Close tightly with a lid, and let stand at room temperature for 2 weeks without exposure to sunlight (see note 1). The garlic can be eaten at this point, but it will taste better as it matures. Refrigerate after opening. The garlic cloves will keep for a few months or longer.</li>
