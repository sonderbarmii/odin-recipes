    <ul class="ingr">Ingredients</ul>
    <li>1 lb Komatsuna or any leafy greens</li>
    <li>1 red chili pepper</li>
    <p></p>
    <ul class="ingr">Seasonings</ul>
    <li>2 Tbs sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 1/2 Tbs rice vinegar (unseasoned)</li>
    <p></p>
    <ol class="steps">Instructions</ol>
    <li>Gather all the ingredients. <strong>Important:</strong> Measure the weight of the vegetables. You will need a heavy object (and a plate) that's 1.5-2 times the weight of the vegetable.</li>
    <li>Cut the greens into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces. Chop 1 red chili pepper into smaller pieces. If you want mild spiciness, discard the seeds.</li>
    <li>Add the greens in a one-gallon glass jar (or any big container).</li>
    <li>Add the chopped red chili pepper, 2 Tbsp sugar, ¼ cup soy sauce, 1 ½ Tbsp rice vinegar.</li>
    <li>WIth your hands (covered with plastic gloves), mix everything together well.</li>
    <li>Place a flat plate on top of the greens and then put a weight (1.5-2 times the weight of vegetable) on top of the plate. I used a mason jar with water.</li>
    <li>Close the lid (or cover with a plastic wrap) and set aside at room temperature for 6 hours.</li>
    <li>Squeeze the liquid out and transfer it to an airtight container.</li>
    <p></p>
